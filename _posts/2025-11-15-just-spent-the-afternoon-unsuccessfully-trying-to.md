Just spent the afternoon (unsuccessfully) trying to get a free inkjet printer I was given to print. It's the first inkjet printer I've had since uni.

To think I have lived a whole 20 years without having to be reminded what an utterly cursed technology cheap inkjet printers are. I never should have let the damn thing in my home 😑
