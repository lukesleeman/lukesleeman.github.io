Last weekend I had an incredible time presenting on "The Principal's of Modularization" at the [@gdgmelbourne](https://aus.social/@gdgmelbourne) Devfest.

As always the energy from the Melbourne mobile developer community was amazing - so many insightful conversations, both during the sessions and in the hallways afterward. It was great to catch up with so many people from the community.

I presented on "The Principles of Modularisation" - sharing our journey at ANZ Plus as we transformed our monolithic Android codebase into a modular architecture. We covered:

- The fundamental principles behind modularisation and team codebase structure
- How we aligned our solution with those principles
- Planning and executing a major architectural shift across a large team
- The key components that make an Android modularisation effort successful

Huge thanks to the organizers for putting together such a fantastic event, and to everyone who attended my session and shared their own experiences. The hallway discussions were honestly some of the best parts of the day!
