Awesome dragon boat regatta! I'm hugely proud to have been part of the CYSM Seadragons crew that took home 3rd place in the 2k Mixed 12s at the Hualien International Dragon Boat Festival.

This is a massive milestone for us: our club's first medal at an international regatta!

On top of the podium finish, our crew also pushed hard to make the semi-finals in the 500m and 200m mixed 12s races.

The venue in Hualien was stunningâ€”racing between cloud-topped mountains was unforgettable. Loved the strong competition and the friendly, collegial atmosphere.
