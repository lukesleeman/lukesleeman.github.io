# New Site, New Experiment

I'm doing a "create 10 things in 10 days" experiment to test out agentic AI tools. This personal website rebuild is day 1.

## The Process

Working with Cline (an AI coding assistant), we:
- Planned a minimal 3-page architecture 
- Migrated from a simple .md file to Jekyll + Hydeout theme
- Built the structure in about an hour

## First Impressions

Honestly surprised by how well this worked. The AI understood the requirements, proposed sensible solutions, and handled the technical implementation smoothly.

9 more experiments to go. Let's see what we can build next.
