[#QT](https://aus.social/tags/QT) [https://hachyderm.io/@ZacSweers/115573116273837202](https://hachyderm.io/@ZacSweers/115573116273837202) this is a really good write-up that talks through executing a large, difficult, cross-cutting change on a significant code base! 

Lots of really interesting info - since a di system can't be controlled at runtime by feature flags , I particularly like the way they ran both systems side by side, using the CI to build variants which used each di system.
