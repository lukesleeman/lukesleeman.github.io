## Hey There! 👋

I'm a Principal Android Engineer at Mantel Group, passionate about building diverse, inclusive, and high-performing teams. Over 7 years leading complex mobile projects, I've helped scale teams from 2 to 80+ developers.

## Recent Highlights

- Spent 4+ years with the ANZ Plus Android team, one of the largest mobile teams in the Southern Hemisphere
- Helped build Australia's fastest-growing digital bank (now at $14B in deposits!)

- Guided the team through both a complete UI overhaul with Jetpack Compose and kicked off a multi-year modularisation effort

- Spoke at DevFest Melbourne & Auckland on Zero Tech Debt
